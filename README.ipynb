    "**Answer**: Yes, by default, Django signals run in the same database transaction as the caller. Specifically, signals like `post_save` and `post_delete` are executed after the changes have been made in the database, within the same transaction. If an exception is raised in the signal handler, it will not affect the already committed database changes, whereas the `pre_save` and `pre_delete` signals occur before the transaction is committed. To conclusively prove that Django signals run in the same transaction, you can use a signal handler that raises an exception and verify whether the database changes are rolled back. Here, we'll use a `post_save` signal."
